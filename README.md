### Hi, I am Maria Skevofylaka

I am an undergraduate student with a strong background in Data Structures and Algorithms and 4 years of coding experience. I like building software
following good programming practices and I am interested in computer security, blockchain technology and web application development. I am
also approachable, a good listener, a fast learner and I love to collaborate with others.

Also these are some of my stats:
